# Chip-8 Lua Implementation
*Made with Love2D* <br>
I have more than one project dedicated to making a Chip-8 emulator/VM, and that's ok. I *want* to learn this stuff so badly, but in typical hobby-programmer fasion, I can't finish any projects. I have my [attempt in rust](https://github.com/jasonknoll/Emulation/tree/main/C8) alongside this one, with my goal to finish both of them. 

## Another Chip-8 project?
Yes. I want to learn about emulation dev and this is the first speed bump a developer needs to get over before moving on. Love2D follows the very simple "init, update, draw" loop that systems like Pico-8 implement, and those are great for getting things up and running -- which is all I need for this. I want to make a C8 that passes all the test roms, then I want to try a Game Boy or something similar. Love also support Android which is a platform I would love to target with my next couple projects.
